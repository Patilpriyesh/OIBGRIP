OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP FOR DATA SCIENCE 

1) Task1: Iris flower classification ----->>>
   •Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ according to their
    measurements.
   
   •Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species,
    and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
   
   •The accuracy score of the Iris data is reported as 100%, indicating a perfect classification.
   
3) Task2: Sales prediction using Python ----->>>
   •Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
   such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
   advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
   
   •Typically, a product and service-based business always need a Data Scientist to predict
   their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
   product. So let’s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

   •The accuracy score of the sales prediction data is reported as 88.12%.

4) Task3: Unemployment rate in India during COVID-19 ---->>>
   •The objective of the analysis is -To know the covid-19 impact on the job market
   •which state survives and which state has more impact on
   •Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
   •who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. you can see a sharp in the code.
   •increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
